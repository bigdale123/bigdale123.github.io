I've been a VSCode user for basically all the time I've been writing code, I've tried Neovim and Vim before and couldn't get used to the keyboard shortcuts. Now that my preferred Desktop environment is i3wm, keyboard shortcuts have become more common. Basically what i'm saying is, it's time to at least branch out and try vim based editing for real. I do plan on using some plugins, which I will cover after I learn basic navigation and such.

This post was originally intended to be a complete article detailing what key binds I was going to learn *and* getting Neovim setup with some plugins and settings to help out anybody else that got intimidated by the learning curve. *However*, turns out there are **lots** of key binds that are really useful (imagine that: lots of key binds in a key bind oriented text editor) and this portion of the post ballooned in size ([I gripe about this in the Editor's note](#editors-note). I felt i'd bust it up into two posts, one for vim keybinds (this post) and one for configuring Neovim with plugins and settings.

A great resource is [Vim Cheat Sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/), which has most of the common key binds detailed. I will be picking and choosing from this list for this article, mainly so that I can cut out features that I do not use currently. It should make the transition process easier, and I can still learn the other functionality at a later date if I need to. Basically, i'm using this as my own documentation on how to use vim.

Lastly, before I jump into this, you don't have to use vim or Neovim to take advantage of the vim style keybindings. There exist many plugins for many editors that replicate this functionality. Here we go!

### Editor's Note:

WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?! I ended up writing down a little bit from each section of the cheat sheet, because I kept finding stuff and going "oh that's cool". What I had planned on being a very basic list of commands to get started, and then building onto it later, ended up being an EXHAUSTIVE (but not complete) list of commands and key binds to be used in vim. I guess it's good that the work is already done, but MAN. I'm gonna have to take a nap. 

Let this be a warning to *all*: The rabbit hole can go as deep as you want to. Be Careful!

# Vim Modes
***

Yes, yes, back to back memes. Gotta have fun with it, y'know?

Vim has different modes for accomplishing different tasks. They are:
- Normal Mode
	- The default mode, used for navigation and executing commands.
	- To get back to Normal mode from any other mode, hit `Esc` or type `Ctrl + [`.
- Insert Mode
	- Used for inserting and editing text.
	- Entered by typing any [Insert Mode](#insert-mode) keybinds.
- Visual Mode
	- Used for selecting text
	- Entered by typing:
		- `v` to do character wise selection
		- `V` to do line wise selection
		- `Ctrl + v` to do Block Selection
- Command-Line Mode
	- Used for executing [vim commands](#commands)
	- Entered by typing `:` (usually most commands are document as something like `:q`)
- Replace Mode
	- Similar to Insert mode, but replaces existing characters instead of inserting new ones.
	- Entered by typing `R`
- Select Mode
	- Similar to Visual mode but behaves similar to selection in other editors
		- Typing replaces the selection
	- Entered by typing `gh`, `gH`, or `g<C-h>`
The next section will be all the "most practical" (more common) keybinds you might need to know. It is not an exhaustive list, and is also what *I* personally think would be necessary or convenient to *me*. If you have the time, I would recommend you scroll through the cheat sheet mentioned next and see if there is anything you would like to be able to use.
# (What ended up being) A Mostly exhaustive list of vim commands
***
As a side note, if you don't understand *what* a keybind does, ChatGPT gives some really good explanations with examples.
## Cursor Movement
- Arrow Keys will move the cursor around, but the "vim" way is to use `h,j,k,l`. Use either.
	- `h` moves the cursor left
	- `j` moves the cursor down
	- `k` moves the cursor up
	- `l` moves the cursor right
- `<line number>gg` or `<line number>G` will jump the cursor to the line number typed.
	- `gg` on its own will jump the cursor to the first line in the document
	- `G` on its own will jump the cursor to the last line in the document
- Jumping within the screen
	- `H` will jump the cursor to the top of the screen
	- `M` will jump the cursor to the middle of the screen
	- `L` will jump the cursor to the bottom of the screen
- Jumping to a paragraph/function/block
	- `}` jumps to the next paragraph (next empty line)
	- `{` jumps to the previous paragraph (next empty line)
- Scrolling the Screen
	- `zz` will scroll the screen until the current line is in the center of the screen
	- `zt` will scroll the screen until the current line is at the top of the screen
	- `zb` will scroll the screen until the current line is at the bottom of the screen
	- `Ctrl + e` will move the screen down one line (without moving cursor)
	- `Ctrl + y` will move the screen up one line (without moving cursor)
	- `Ctrl + b` will move the screen up one page (cursor to last line)
	- `Ctrl + f` will move the screen down one page (cursor to first line)
	- `Ctrl + d` will move the cursor and screen down 1/2 page
	- `Ctrl + u` will move the cursor and screen up 1/2 page
## Insert Mode
This is the mode you will be in to actually write text. Any of these commands will place you in Insert mode (Except for the commands that take you out of insert mode ðŸ™‚):
- `i` will insert text before the cursor
- `I` will insert text at the beginning of the line
- `a` will insert text (append) after the cursor
- `A` will insert text (append) at the end of the line
- `o` will append text (open) a new line below the current line
- `O` will append text (open) a new line above the current line
## Editing in Normal Mode
- `u` will undo a change
- `Ctrl + r` will redo a change
- `.` will repeat a change
- `ciw` will replace an entire word
	- Place the cursor anywhere on/in a word, run `ciw<replacement word>`, and the word you had selected will be replaced with the replacement.
- `cw` will perform a change until the end of a word
	- `ce` will also do this but only works in the middle of a word. `cw` is more versatile since it works at the beginning and in the middle of a word.
- `cc` will change an entire line, and is generally (but not always) faster than deleting and retyping the line.
	- `c$` or `C` is similar to `cc` but is intended to replace *part* of a line instead of the whole line.
- `xp` swaps two letters, intended to be used to fix typos.
	- `x` deletes the highlighted letter
	- `p` pastes the previously deleted letter
## Visual Mode Commands
Visual Mode is entered by typing `v`. You select a block of text with your cursor.
- `>` shifts text to the right
- `<` shifts text to the left
- `y` yanks (copies) the selected text
- `d` deletes the selected text
- `~` switches the case of the selected text (e.g. `false` becomes `FALSE`.)
- `u` changes the selected text to lowercase
- `U` changes the selected text to uppercase
## Cutting, Copying, and Pasting
- `yy` yanks (copies) a line
- `<number>yy` yanks (copies) `<number>` numbers of lines
- `yw` yanks from where the cursor is to the beginning of the next word
- `yiw` yanks the word under the cursor
- `y$` yanks from cursor to the end of the line
- `p` puts (pastes) the clipboard after the cursor
- `P` puts (pastes) the clipboard before the cursor
- `dd` deletes (cuts) a line
- `<number>dd` deletes (cuts) `<number>` number of lines
- `dw` deletes (cuts) from the cursor to the start of the next word
- `diw` deletes (cuts) the word under the cursor
- `d$` or `D` deletes (cuts) from cursor to the end of the line
- `x` deletes (cuts) a character
## Indenting
- `>>` indents a line one shiftwidth
- `<<` de-indents a line one shiftwidth
- `gg=G` re indents the entire buffer (Visual Mode)
- `=%` re indents the entire block inside a `()` or `{}` (Cursor must be on one of the braces)
- `]p` puts (pastes) with adjusted indentation
- `<number>==` re indents `<number>` number of lines
## Registers
- `:reg[isters]` shows all registers content
- `"xy` yanks whatever is selected into register x
- `"xp` pastes whatever is in register x where the cursor is
- `"+y` yanks whatever is selected into the system clipboard
- `"+p` pastes from the system clipboard where the cursor is
- Special Registers:
	- `0` holds the last yank
	- `"` is an unnamed register, holds the last delete or yank
	- `%` holds the current file name
	- `#` holds an alternate file name
	- `+` holds the system clipboard
	- `/` holds the last search pattern
	- `:` holds the last command run
	- `.` holds the last inserted text
	- `-` holds the last small delete (less than a line)
	- `=` is the expression register
		- This register holds the result of an expression, handy for not having to use `:call`
	- `_` is the black hole register
		- Like `/dev/null` as a register, anything written to it disappears
		- Can be useful when you want to delete something but not affect any registers
## Macros
- `qa` records a macro and stores it as macro `a`
- `q` stops recording whatever macro is currently being recorded
- `@a` runs macro `a`
- `@@` runs the last run macro
## Marks and Positions
- `:marks` shows a list of marks
- `m<letter>` sets the current position as mark `<letter>`
- `` `<letter> `` jumps the cursor to mark `<letter>`
- `` y`<letter> `` yanks text from the cursor to the position of mark `<letter>`
- Special Marks:
	- `` `0 `` moves the cursor to the position where Vim was previously exited
	- `` `" `` moves the cursor to the position when last editing this file
	- `` `. `` moves the cursor to the position of the last change in this file
	- `` \`` `` moves the cursor to the position before the last jump
- `:ju[mps]` lists all the jumps made
	- `Ctrl + i` moves the cursor to the newer position in jump list
	- `Ctrl + o` moves the cursor to the older position in jump list
- `:changes` lists all the positions where changes have been made
	- `g,` moves the cursor to the newer position in change list
	- `g;` moves the cursor to the older position in change list
# Commands
***
These are used less like keybinds and more like commands.
Hence the name, *Commands*.
## Global commands
- `:h[elp] <keyword>` opens the help for keyword
- `:sav[eas] <filename>` will save the file using the filename provided
- `:clo[se]` closes the current pane
- `:ter[minal]` opens a terminal window
- `K` opens the man page for the word under the cursor
## Exiting
- `:w` saves the current file, but does not exit.
- `:wq` or `:x` or `ZZ` saves the current file and then quits
- `:q` quits out of vim (will not work if there are unsaved changes)
- `:q!` or `ZQ` quits out of vim and throws out unsaved changes (quit without saving)
- `:wqa` saves the file and quits on *every* tab.
## Search and Replace
- `/pattern` will search for a pattern
- `?pattern` will search backward for a pattern
- `n` goes to the next result of the search in same direction
- `N` goes to the next result of the in opposite direction
- `\vpattern` is 'very magic' pattern: non-alphanumeric characters are interpreted as special regex symbols (no escaping needed)
- `:%s/old/new/g` will replace all `old` with `new` throughout file
- `:%s/old/new/gc` will replace all `old` with `new` throughout file with confirmations
- `:g/{pattern}/d` will delete all lines containing pattern
- `:g!/{pattern}/d` will delete all lines not containing pattern
## Searching in Multiple Files
- `:vim[grep] /pattern/ {<file>}` searches for pattern in multiple files
- `:cn[ext]` jumps to the next match
- `:cp[revious]` jumps to the previous match
- `:cope[n]` opens a window containing the list of matches
- `:ccl[ose]` closes the window containing the list of matches
## Tabs
- `:tabnew` or `:tabnew <file>` opens a file in a new tab
- `Ctrl + wT` moves the current split window into its own tab
- `gt` or `:tabn[ext]` moves you to the next tab
- `gT` or `:tabp[revious]` moves you to the previous tab
- `#gt` moves you to the # tab
- `:tabm[ove] #` moves the current tab to the \#th position (indexed from 0)
- `:tabo[nly]` closes all tabs except for the current one
## Working with Multiple Files
- `:e[dit] <file>` opens a file in a new buffer
- `:bn[ext]` moves to the next buffer
- `:bp[revious]` moves to the previous buffer
- `:bd[elete]` deletes a buffer (close a file)
- `:b[uffer]#` moves to a buffer by index #
- `:b[uffer] <file>` moves to a buffer by file
- `:ls` or `:buffers` lists all open buffers
- `:sp[lit] <file>` opens a file in a new buffer and split window
- `:vs[plit] <file>` opens a file in a new buffer and vertically split window
- `Ctrl + ws` splits window horizontally
- `Ctrl + wv` splits window vertically
- `Ctrl + ww` switches between windows
- `Ctrl + <movement key>` moves the cursor to the window in the direction of the movement key
