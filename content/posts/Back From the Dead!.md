What's Up! So, last post here was, what, March 2025? Yeah, so I got busy with school and extracurriculars. The main extracurricular though, is a pretty big deal.

I got My Amateur Radio License! Callsign is KR4EII, and I went ahead and got my General license while I was at it. I took my Technician's exam July 1st-ish, and the General was fairly recent, around July 14th. It's something i've wanted to do since high school, and something clicked where I realized "Wait, I can just go take that." So I crammed for a week and took the Tech exam, then the proctors told me after I passed that there's quite a bit of overlap between the tech and the general. So I started studying for the General, which took longer to prepare for, but I passed first try. And I was taking a Summer class for my master's degree during that, probably could have gotten it quicker had I some free time. 

Anyway, that brings us up to date mostly. I have been learning about radio, and taking classes. Content that you might see coming out soon is:
- Ham Radio has never been easier to get into (How to get your license)
- Dipole Antennas & how they work
- End Fed Half Wave Antennas & how they work
- APRS & my love-hate relationship with it
- and more...
And obviously, as I learn more radio stuff there will probably be some extra articles sprinkled in, mainly so I can document new modes I learn (trying to figure out FT8 right now...)

Here's hoping It's not months between posts!
